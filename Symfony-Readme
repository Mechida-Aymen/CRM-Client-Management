environment :
    we dicided to use docker compose for our environment

Code : 
    -> we started by creating the entities (with constraints)
    -> then make the migration and apply this migration in database 
    -> Create the controllers and routes 
    -> we decided to use 3 layers C S R
    -> Creating the Formtypes
    -> Creating the twig templates with one father for the User and the others heritate from that one
    -> Making the validation constraints on the entity (even if we have different Formtypes for that entity the same constraints will be applied)
    -> Use a validator to bes sure that each client have a unique phone number by User
    -> we did use the interfaces and the autowire injection for the depedency inversion
    ->

Security : 
    -> used a doctrine provider 
    -> login from
    -> Roles even we have only a single type of users (for future features)
    -> using voters to be sure that a client or facture can be managed only by the right users
    -> Secure routes
